- 👋 Hi, I’m @Avtstudio. new in this stuff here. really more analog!
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of Audio and Car electronic, sometimes I hav3 may be "stupid" ideas
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, oups trying to learn, how to translate CAN stuff from a Renault to Citroen for a radio exchange.I had a Peugeot CC which unfortunately died.But the RD45 radio and display survived so the idea was to put it into aMegane CC
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this...may be if its ever possible to do some translator like this
